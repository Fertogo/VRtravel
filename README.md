####Inspiration

We wanted to explore the beauties of the world by getting an immersive feel of a city before visiting. Using today's technology we can acomplish this through virtual reality by using a smartphone and Google Cardboard. With this app, we can easily decide wether we want to visit Athens or St. Petersburg by getting as close as possible to the real thing without leaving our room!

####How does it work?

1. Select a city on our website (or let us pick one for you at random).
2. Click on our Chrome extension.
3. Enjoy the photosphere we automatically sent to your Android device!
4. If you like what you see, click the TripAdvisor link on our site to start planning a visit!
